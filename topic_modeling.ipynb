Allied forces launched one of the largest amphibious military assaults in history on the beaches of Normandy, France, aiming to liberate Western Europe from Nazi occupation. Approximately 156,000 troops, including American, British, Canadian, and various other Allied forces, landed on five beachheads: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. The operation involved extensive planning, with deceptive tactics employed to mislead German forces about the invasions timing and location.']\n",
